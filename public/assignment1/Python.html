            <p>•<a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/top-10-in-demand-programming-languages-to-learn-in-2020-4462eb7d8d3e">Python</a>: developed during the 1990s by Guido van Rossum is considered today as one of the most popular programming languages as of the beggining of 2020.</p>
           <p>• Key reasons as to why Python is so popular would include its language design in which it is very productive, its first class integration with c and c++, and its very active community and support. Being able to provide libraries and frameworks for plenty of different areas of production.</p>
           <p>• Being an <a href="https://www.python.org/doc/essays/blurb/">interpreted</a>, object oriented, high level programming language, Python gains popularity to its ability to rapidly develop application. Its simple and easy to learn syntax also reduces the cost of maintenance.</p>
           <p>• <a href= "https://www.python.org/about/apps/">Applications</a> that use Python include web development, scientific and numeric computing, education, desktop GUIs, software development, and business applications.</p>
